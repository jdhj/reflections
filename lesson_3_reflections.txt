When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    A remote repository allows others to share your work and contribute to it. 
    This also acts as a backup, and a useful way to access your own work from other
    locations/devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    An automatic pull for every update might introduce changes that affect your work.
    It would certainly be confusing to code from an unstable source that may change
    without warning. It seems to make more sense to complete your changes, test
    that everything is working, and then deal with the complications of integrating
    it into new versions in a more predictable manner.
